JAXRS Returning List of Instances
=================================

This example is based on Adam Bien Blog http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/jax_rs_retrieving_a_list.

It shows how to handle List of instaces. The example shows the server and client code.

Interesting is also that the server and client code are in the same Project and not in different modules as in some previous examples.
The pom.xml can also be taken as reference for similar cases.
